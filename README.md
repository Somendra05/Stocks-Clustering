# Stocks Clustering Project

### Business Problem

Understanding patterns and relationships between stocks is critical for portfolio optimization, sector analysis, and identifying diversification opportunities. This project aims to cluster stocks based on their historical performance, volatility, and other financial metrics, providing actionable insights for investment strategies.

### Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
	•	Handled missing or incomplete data to ensure dataset integrity.
	•	Standardized features to enable fair comparison across varying scales.
	•	Performed feature selection to focus on metrics like returns, volatility, and volume trends.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Analyzed stock distributions, correlations, and patterns to identify key drivers for clustering.
	•	Visualized trends to understand relationships between features and group similarities.

### 3. Clustering Methodology
	•	Applied K-Means Clustering to group stocks based on their financial performance and risk profiles.
	•	Optimized the number of clusters using Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores to ensure meaningful segmentation.
	•	Compared clusters to validate interpretability and business relevance.

### 4. Dimensionality Reduction
	•	Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while retaining variance.
	•	Enhanced clustering results by focusing on the most critical features derived from PCA components.

### 5. Evaluation
	•	Assessed clustering quality using silhouette scores and visual inspection of clusters in a reduced-dimensional space.
	•	Analyzed intra-cluster and inter-cluster distances to ensure clear separation and compact groupings.

### Results

### Successfully grouped stocks into 4 distinct clusters, each representing unique performance characteristics such as:  
	•	High-growth stocks with high volatility.  
	•	Stable dividend-paying stocks with low risk.  
	•	Underperforming stocks with low returns.  
	•	Volatile speculative stocks with irregular trends.  
	•	PCA Results: Reduced 10+ features into 2 principal components, retaining 85% of the variance, enabling effective visualization and analysis.  
	•	The final clustering provided insights into how stocks can be categorized for tailored investment strategies.  
 
### Key Highlights  
	•	Effective Clustering Strategy: Leveraged K-Means and PCA to uncover hidden patterns in stock behavior.  
	•	Business Insights: Enabled identification of stock categories for investors, improving decision-making for portfolio diversification and risk management.  
	•	Scalable Approach: The methodology is adaptable for larger datasets or inclusion of new financial metrics.  

### Conclusion

This project showcases the power of unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means and PCA in solving real-world problems in finance. The clustering results provide clear, actionable insights that can guide investment decisions and sector-specific analyses, making it a valuable tool for analysts and investors.
